# Simple-Perceptron

This projects implementes a binary classification algorithm with three different classes.




Q4 - Uses the binary perceptron to train classifiers to discriminate between (a) class 1 and class 2, (b) class 2 and class 3, and (c) class 1 and class 3. Report the train and test calssification accuracies for each of the three classifiers after 20 iterations.

Q6 -  Extends the binary perceptron to perform multi-class classification using the 1-vs-rest approach. 

Q7 - Adds an l2 regularisation term to multi-class classifier implemented in Q6. The regularisation coefficients are 0.01,0.1, 10.0 and 100.0 and compare the train and test classification accuracy for each of the three classes.
